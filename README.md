Testing Instructions 
1. Install the Extension
- Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
- Enable Developer Mode in the top-right corner.
- Click “Load unpacked” and select the Blink extension folder.

2. Start Tracking
- Open any website (e.g., YouTube, Google Docs, Reddit).
- Confirm that the floating timer appears and begins tracking your active time on that tab.
- Interact with the page (scroll, type, or click) to simulate active engagement.
- Drag it around the screen to find a place to leave it.

3. Switch Tabs and Observe
- Move between tabs or reload the page; the timer should retain the total time for the same website instead of resetting.
- Stay idle or minimize your browser; the timer should pause automatically during inactivity.

4. Break Reminder
- After 2-4 hours of continuous activity, a break reminder popup should appear, prompting you to take a rest.
- Choose a break duration (10, 20, or 30 minutes, or manually enter a time up to 45 minutes).
- When the break ends, ensure that a popup notification appears stating “Break’s Over” and that the timer resumes.

5. Customization
- Open the Blink Options Page from the extension’s settings.
- Customize the theme color, font style, and select which websites the extension should track.
- Verify that your preferences are saved and persist across browser restarts.

6. Category Management
- Under “Manage Categories”, create or remove categories (e.g., Study, Leisure, Work).
- Visit websites associated with those categories and confirm that Blink correctly labels them.
